                    <p className="about">A litte about me: I'm a former student from Lambda School/Bloom Institute Full Stack Coding bootcamp. I started my coding journey around early January 2021 after I graduated college. <br/> I graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelors degree in biology. <br/> You may be wondering why I'm in tech now? Well it's because my previous goals of being a pharmacist weren't my own goals. They were my parents' goals. <br/> I was hesitant at first to switch career paths so it took me until the end of September of 2021 to full deiciate my time and commit to a coding bootcamp and I haven't looked back since. <br/> A little bit more about me, my hobbies include: volleyball, ultimate frisbee, hanging out with my friends, and playing some video games! <br/> Oh, and coding of course!</p>
